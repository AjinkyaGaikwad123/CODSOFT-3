TASK 3
ATM Machine Simulation
Description
This project is a simple ATM Machine Simulation that mimics real-world ATM functionality. It allows users to interact with an ATM interface to perform actions such as withdrawing money, depositing money, and checking their balance. The system is designed using object-oriented principles, with separate classes for the ATM machine and the user's bank account.

Features:
ATM Class: Provides a user interface for the ATM, allowing users to choose between different actions such as withdrawal, deposit, and balance check.
Bank Account Class: Represents a user's bank account, storing and modifying the balance.
Methods for ATM Functions: Implements methods for the actions (e.g., withdraw(amount), deposit(amount), checkBalance()).
Input Validation: Ensures that the userâ€™s actions are valid, such as ensuring sufficient balance for withdrawals or valid amounts for deposits.
User Feedback: Displays messages to the user based on their action, including success or failure feedback.
